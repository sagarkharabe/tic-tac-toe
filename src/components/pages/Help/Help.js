          <b>Tic Tac Toe </b> It is a pencil and paper game between two players:{" "}
          <b className="o-symbol">O</b> y <b className="x-symbol">X</b>, which
          mark the spaces of a 3 Ã— 3 board in turn. A player wins if he manages
          to have a line of three of his symbols: the line can be horizontal,
          vertical or diagonal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The players soon discover that the perfect game ends in a draw
          regardless of what the first player plays with.

          The same simplicity of the three-in-a-row game makes it ideal as a
          pedagogical tool to teach the concepts of game theory and the branch
          of artificial intelligence that is responsible for the search for game
          trees.

        <p>
          Each player must only place their symbol once per turn and must not be
          on a square already played. In case the player cheats The winner will
          be the other. You should get a straight line or diagonal by symbol. If
          the player marks a box, even if it is the minimum mark, you must put
          symbol of the next play on that box.
